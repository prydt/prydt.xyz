<p><strong>2025-09-17</strong></p>
<p>I had a blog in one form or another for a while... but I haven't really blogged consistently. A problem as old as time, really.</p>
<p>My first commit to <a href="https://github.com/prydt/algorithms/commits/master/">prydt/algorithms</a> is from 2017!</p>
<p>I've moved from Jekyll to Hugo, and now from Hugo to Zola. The only real thing that has changed recently is that I am no longer using an off-the-shelf theme. I found that while some themes looked really neat, a lot of them were far too complex for my needs, and I had trouble modifying them to fit my needs.</p>
<p>My current setup is exactly what I need: just default Zola, with a tiny style sheet.</p>
<p>Finally, there is are a couple things I want to say about my thoughts on blogging. The first is that writing really helps in thinking.</p>
<p>There's a quote attributed to Leslie Lamport:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Writing is nature's way of telling us how lousy our thinking is. - Leslie Lamport</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and although I cannot actually find a real source for this, I deeply agree with the sentiment.</p>
<p>I also believe that perfectionism and wanting to have a perfect blog with only the highest quality posts is actually hampering my ability to become a better writer. This isn't to say I'm going to put out utter garbage, but I will be loosening my standards and just trying to be a more consistent writer in general. Consistency and quantity will hopefully result in eventual quality.</p>
<p>Finally, my plan is to make blogging a much more social activity. I will share my blog posts with friends, and I am making a blogging circle. Initially it might just be a Discord channel among friends, and that's enough.</p>
