<p>Writing is nature's way of telling us how lousy our thinking is. - (This quote is sometimes attributed to Leslie Lamport, but he is actually quoting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120121030813/http://www.budiu.info/blog/2007/05/03/an-interview-with-leslie-lamport/">Dick Guindon</a>)</p>

<p>Although I've had a blog in one form or another since <a href="https://github.com/prydt/algorithms/commit/c790175d077dc93b6dbb8ef59ea8f849db940245">2017</a>, blogging never became a habit for me. I'd always have ideas but either never written them down. Whenever I did write something, I tried to do something too big or too polished.</p>
<p>Here's how I plan to change this.</p>
<h2 id="1-quantity-has-a-quality-all-its-own">1. Quantity has a quality all its own.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup></h2>
<p>It's unintuitive, but I believe that lowering my standards to some degree will actually improve my writing quality in the long run.</p>
<p>The desire to have a blog with only the highest quality posts is actually hampering my ability to become a better writer. While I don't think you throw out all quality control, loosening standards in favor of consistency will hopefully result in increased quality.</p>
<h2 id="2-don-t-futz-with-it">2. Don't futz with it.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup></h2>
<p>Like so many aspirational bloggers, I fell into the trap of spending more time on my blogging setup than actually writing. I started on <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, switched to <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, and now I'm on <a href="https://www.getzola.org/">Zola</a>. None of this matters to me or to readers.</p>
<p>While it's nice to have a cool custom theme, etc, etc, nothing matters more than just writing.</p>
<p>I've settled on a setup and I'm not going to futz with it anymore.</p>
<h2 id="3-make-it-social">3. Make it social!</h2>
<p>I've enlisted a group of friends to join a "blogging circle" where we all share our writing and keep each other encouraged to continue to be consistent with it.</p>
<p>I will link my friend's posts here from time to time and I can't wait to do this more.</p>
<h2 id="blog-trailer">Blog Trailer</h2>
<p>Here are some topics that interest me and I hope to cover in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Distributed Systems</li>
<li>Programming languages</li>
<li>Concurrency</li>
<li>Hashtables</li>
<li>Politics</li>
<li>Music</li>
<li>Anything I'm reading</li>
<li>... really anything, we'll see.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's to consistency!
