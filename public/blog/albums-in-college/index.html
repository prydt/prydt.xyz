<p>Music has the uncanny ability to always remind me of certain people or certain times. Last year I graduated college, and I wanted to share some of the albums that stuck with me the most. You'll definitely realize that these are mostly in the vein of hyperpop or indie rock adjacent stuff.</p>
<p>I'll include a few songs from each album that I think are standout so you can give each a quick taste but each and every one of these albums has been picked for being pretty cohesive and consistent in quality.</p>
<p>Here's a brief set of "tasting notes" from some of my favorite albums of recent years:</p>
<h2 id="1-100-gecs-1000-gecs">1. 100 gecs - 1000 gecs</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>(okayyyy... this album might not be the best to start off with. many others on this list are way more approachable. if this isn't your cup of matcha soy milk latte , i very much get it.  but for the freaks like me... this will change your life
)</p>
</blockquote>
