![A collage featuring the album covers described in this article](/album-collage.jpg)

Music has the uncanny ability to always remind me of certain people or certain times. Last year I graduated college, and I wanted to share some of the albums that stuck with me the most. You'll definitely realize that these are mostly in the vein of hyperpop or indie rock adjacent stuff.

I'll include a few songs from each album that I think are standout so you can give each a quick taste but each and every one of these albums has been picked for being pretty cohesive and consistent in quality.

Here's a brief set of "tasting notes" from some of my favorite albums of recent years:

## 1. 100 gecs - 1000 gecs
> (okayyyy... this album might not be the best to start off with. many others on this list are way more approachable. if this isn't your cup of matcha soy milk latte , i very much get it.  but for the freaks like me... this will change your life
)

- got me into hyperpop
- shrill, harsh
- bombastic
- autotune, catchy as hell
- doesn't take itself too seriously. very fun

top songs: 745 sticky, money machine, ringtone




## 2. underscores - fishmonger / fearmonger

> The goddess of fortune was smiling on me when by chance, i attended a 100 gecs concert where the opener was none other than Underscores. She quickly became my favorite favorite favorite hyperpop musician of all time. 

- extremely approachable hyperpop
- very catchy, very tasteful
- some of the best production ever


top songs: second hand embarrassment, bozo bozo bozo, spoiled little brat, your favorite sidekick

if you like this album, go listen to Fearmonger and [story of s*nny](https://soundcloud.com/underscores/snny) (on soundcloud only???? WHY)

## 3. glass beach - the first glass beach album

- lowkey emo
- thoughtful lyrics
- energetic
- really raw vocals

top songs: cold weather, bedroom community, classic j dies and goes to hell part 1, glass beach

## 4. wild party - phantom pop

- no skip album
- just really really good indie pop.
- nothing more to really say
- if there was any justice, it would've been far more successful when it came out. (like Tally Hall)

top songs: OutRight, Life's Too Short, Take My Advice, Violet, Chasin' Honey, Lo-Fi Children

## 5. jhariah - a beginners guide to faking your death
> One of the most cohesive albums on this list. Tells a very fun story.

- jazzy
- musicial
- genre bending
- incredible vocal range
- villainous

top songs: ENTER: A BEGINNERS GUIDE TO FAKING YOUR DEATH, PRESSURE BOMB 3?!?!, DEBT COLLECTOR, Flight of the Crows

## 6. good kid - good kid

- really solid indie rock
- songs are similar, but in a good way

top songs: Alchemist, Tell Me You Know, Witches

## 7. vampire weekend - vampire weekend
>  saw them live, one of the best concerts I've been to. oldest album on this list which has a very recent skew

- fancy indie rock
- ivy league vibes
- aristocracy


top songs: Campus, Mansard Roof, Oxford Comma, M79

## 8. friday pilots club - nowhere
> Honestly just go listen to everything made by them. Lots of great singles not on this album.
