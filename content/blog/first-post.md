> Writing is nature's way of telling us how lousy our thinking is. - (This quote is sometimes attributed to Leslie Lamport, but he is actually quoting [Dick Guindon](https://web.archive.org/web/20120121030813/http://www.budiu.info/blog/2007/05/03/an-interview-with-leslie-lamport/))

Although I've had a blog in one form or another since [2017](https://github.com/prydt/algorithms/commit/c790175d077dc93b6dbb8ef59ea8f849db940245), blogging never became a habit for me. I'd always have ideas but either never written them down. Whenever I did write something, I tried to do something too big or too polished.

Here's how I plan to change this.

## 1. Quantity has a quality all its own.[^1] 

It's unintuitive, but I believe that lowering my standards to some degree will actually improve my writing quality in the long run. 

The desire to have a blog with only the highest quality posts is actually hampering my ability to become a better writer. While I don't think you throw out all quality control, loosening standards in favor of consistency will hopefully result in increased quality.

## 2. Don't futz with it.[^2]

Like so many aspirational bloggers, I fell into the trap of spending more time on my blogging setup than actually writing. I started on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), switched to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and now I'm on [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/). None of this matters to me or to readers.

While it's nice to have a cool custom theme, etc, etc, nothing matters more than just writing. 

I've settled on a setup and I'm not going to futz with it anymore.

## 3. Make it social!

I've enlisted a group of friends to join a "blogging circle" where we all share our writing and keep each other encouraged to continue to be consistent with it.

I will link my friend's posts here from time to time and I can't wait to do this more.

## Blog Trailer
Here are some topics that interest me and I hope to cover in no particular order:
- Distributed Systems
- Programming languages
- Concurrency
- Hashtables
- Politics
- Music
- Anything I'm reading
- ... really anything, we'll see.

Here's to consistency!
